# Industry & Thematic Research

I’m interested in how industries change over time - what drives growth, where things break, and how capital, policy and technology interact.  
This repo is a place to collect short notes on sectors and themes I’m trying to understand better.

## What’s here now

- *Cleantech’s Carnage & Its Redemption*  
  An article on how cleantech went from hype to collapse in its first wave, and why the current cycle looks more grounded.

## What to expect over time

As I study more sectors, I’ll gradually add:

- industry overviews,
- thematic pieces (e.g. capital cycles, regulation, technology shifts),
- and any follow-up notes that clarify my own thinking.

Nothing here is investment advice - it’s just me trying to make sense of how different parts of the economy work.
