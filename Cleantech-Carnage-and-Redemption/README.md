# Cleantech’s Carnage & Its Redemption

This piece looks at how cleantech went from being “the next big thing” to a complete collapse — and why the new wave finally feels different.

It covers the excitement that built up in the 2000s, the harsh reality check that followed, and the slow, more grounded comeback the sector is seeing today.

## What this note is about

Cleantech’s first boom was full of optimism — climate fears were rising, oil was expensive, and startups promised bold solutions. But the hype got ahead of the technology. Solar and gas prices moved faster than expected, VC money retreated, and more than a hundred companies vanished almost overnight.

The second wave is nothing like the first.  
Founders are more realistic, technology is actually ready, and investors know this isn’t a “quick return” space. Government support is stronger, and the ecosystem feels more patient and serious.

This note walks through that journey — what went wrong, what changed, and why this new cycle stands on much sturdier ground.

## Why I wrote it

I’ve always been interested in how industries evolve, especially when they sit at the intersection of *technology, money, and real-world needs*. Cleantech is one of those spaces where the story is bigger than the companies involved — it’s about incentives, survival, timing and hard lessons learned.

This write-up is my attempt to capture that story in a simple, readable way.
